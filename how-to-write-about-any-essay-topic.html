            <h1>English Essay: How to Write about ANY Essay Topic</h1>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <img src="images/how-to-write-about-any-essay-topic.jpg" alt="how to write about any essay topic" width="720" height="500">
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Okay, so you need to write an English&nbsp;essay. How do you get a high score? And&nbsp;&nbsp;what do you write about? If you're asking&nbsp;these questions, this is the&nbsp;article for you. Hi, my name is&nbsp;Ndekere and in this article, I'm&nbsp;going to show you an essay structure that you can use for high level English exams like&nbsp;IELTS, or PTE or TOEFL, or even just for high&nbsp;&nbsp;school essays.</p>
<p>It works in any situation for any&nbsp;essay type, or any question prompt. And speaking&nbsp;&nbsp;of essay types and question prompts, we need to&nbsp;start there. Essay types and question prompts.&nbsp;&nbsp;So before I show you that unbelievable essay&nbsp;structure, we first need to make sure that you&nbsp;&nbsp;fulfil the requirements of the essay you're given.&nbsp;And to do this, you need to do one thing and one&nbsp;&nbsp;thing only.</p>
<h2>Answer the question.</h2>
<p>It sounds&nbsp;simple, but people always seem to screw it up.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I give you a question prompt like this one&nbsp;that requires you to write a comparison essay&nbsp;&nbsp;by providing advantages and disadvantages,&nbsp;then just do that. In some countries,&nbsp;&nbsp;most people prefer to rent their houses rather&nbsp;than buy their houses. What are the advantages and&nbsp;&nbsp;disadvantages of renting a home?</p>
<p>Okay, now that we&nbsp;have gotten that out of the way, we can move on to&nbsp;&nbsp;a powerful and flexible essay structure that you&nbsp;can use for any essay question.</p>
<p>Just before we do,&nbsp;&nbsp;click that subscribe button for excellent&nbsp;English language videos each and every week.&nbsp;&nbsp;The essay structure. The essay structure I want&nbsp;to show you looks like this. This is the ultimate&nbsp;&nbsp;essay structure.</p>
<p>Trust me, it's perfectly&nbsp;coherent and logical. And once you learn it,&nbsp;&nbsp;you'll never forget it. I'm going to teach you&nbsp;how to write an introduction that connects to&nbsp;&nbsp;both your body paragraphs and mirrors your&nbsp;conclusion paragraph, and I'll show you how&nbsp;&nbsp;the conclusion paragraph will connect back to&nbsp;the body paragraphs and mirror the introduction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Honestly, this essay structure is so simple&nbsp;and so powerful that you might end up teaching&nbsp;&nbsp;the class or you can keep it a secret and get&nbsp;great scores just for yourself, it's up to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel free to share this&nbsp;article on social media&nbsp;if you want.</p>
<p>Let's now look at each part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;essay and understand why each paragraph exists.&nbsp;Paragraph purposes. So a standard essay will have&nbsp;&nbsp;four parts, an introduction, some body&nbsp;paragraphs, maybe two, three or more. And&nbsp;&nbsp;a conclusion. There's actually a very simple&nbsp;and powerful way to understand the purpose&nbsp;&nbsp;of each paragraph.</p>
<p>In the introduction, you&nbsp;simply tell the reader what you're going to&nbsp;&nbsp;tell them and then in your body paragraphs&nbsp;you tell them. And then in the conclusion,&nbsp;&nbsp;you tell the reader what you told them. That's&nbsp;it. That's the purpose of each paragraph.&nbsp;&nbsp;And it gives you some idea of how it's all&nbsp;interconnected.</p>
<p>Keep it simple and keep it clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers and examiners hate paragraphs and essays&nbsp;that lack purpose.</p>
<p>You're not writing a novel or a&nbsp;&nbsp;poem or a biography, you're answering a question&nbsp;using a specific structure. Make a quick plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just before we start writing, I hate to&nbsp;tell you, but you do need to make a quick&nbsp;&nbsp;plan.</p>
<p>You should never start writing without&nbsp;thinking the question through. If you start&nbsp;&nbsp;writing without planning, you end up deleting&nbsp;entire sections and wasting heaps of time,&nbsp;&nbsp;you need to set a direction for your essay. Let's&nbsp;plan my essay, it will only take a few seconds,&nbsp;&nbsp;and it's going to relate to yours. So&nbsp;my essay prompt says, In some countries,&nbsp;&nbsp;most people prefer to rent their houses rather&nbsp;than buy their houses. And the question asks,&nbsp;&nbsp;what is an advantage and a disadvantage of renting&nbsp;a home?</p>
<p>So we need to think for a minute here.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to write my essay. I need to come&nbsp;up with one advantage of renting a house and&nbsp;&nbsp;one disadvantage of renting a house. That's what&nbsp;the question asked.</p>
<p>So that's what we better do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Advantage of renting. Well what about; you&nbsp;can move house when you want. Disadvantage&nbsp;&nbsp;of renting? Well, it's kind of a waste of&nbsp;money because you're not paying off the house. That was pretty easy.</p>
<p>My tip here is to think the&nbsp;question through, relax and come up with the main&nbsp;&nbsp;idea or ideas. If you can identify the most&nbsp;important idea or ideas, then your essay will come&nbsp;&nbsp;together and flow much more easily.</p>
<p>If you get&nbsp;stuck on minor ideas, it becomes harder to write.&nbsp;&nbsp;But cool, I have my main ideas. So I'm now ready&nbsp;to write my essay.</p>
<p>Ready? The introduction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alright, so we're going to&nbsp;write a three part introduction,&nbsp;&nbsp;not necessarily three sentences, you&nbsp;can write more sentences if you want,&nbsp;&nbsp;but there needs to be three parts. First, you&nbsp;need to write a broad background statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, you need to rewrite the question&nbsp;prompt in your own words.</p>
<p>Third, you need&nbsp;&nbsp;to write a thesis statement. Stay with me, this&nbsp;isn't hard, I'll show you how to write mine.&nbsp;&nbsp;And you can follow along and copy the same&nbsp;structure for your essay at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp;So number one, the introduction sentence, where&nbsp;we write a broad background statement. Your&nbsp;&nbsp;first sentence is very broad, you almost need&nbsp;to pretend that your teacher or examiner or&nbsp;&nbsp;whoever is going to read your essay has no&nbsp;idea of what you're writing about.</p>
<p>And as such,&nbsp;&nbsp;you need to give them some background information.&nbsp;You can't just jump straight into your arguments,&nbsp;&nbsp;you need to set the context. So let's look at my&nbsp;question prompt. And let me show you a great first&nbsp;&nbsp;sentence for your essay. In some countries, most&nbsp;people prefer to rent their houses rather than buy&nbsp;&nbsp;their houses.</p>
<p>Alright, so what's the broad social&nbsp;context here? Every essay has a social context.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this one is about renting versus buying&nbsp;houses. So I'm going to write something like:&nbsp;&nbsp;For some people, the dream of owning a&nbsp;home is not possible or is unfavourable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty simple, right?</p>
<h2>I've written a simple&nbsp;sentence, it's almost obvious.</h2>
<p>And yours&nbsp;&nbsp;needs to be obvious as well. Don't make it&nbsp;confusing or profound. I've simply written that&nbsp;&nbsp;some people can't buy a house or don't want to buy&nbsp;a house. It's actually a great opening sentence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember that essay diagram I showed you earlier?&nbsp;Let's look at it again. So the introduction&nbsp;&nbsp;is an upside down pyramid and your first sentence,&nbsp;the first sentence of the introduction is broad.&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction sentence number two, rewrite the&nbsp;essay prompt in your own words. So the second&nbsp;&nbsp;sentence of your introduction should simply&nbsp;rewrite the essay prompt in your own words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way to say this is you need to paraphrase&nbsp;the essay prompt.</p>
<p>So let's do it to mine. Here's&nbsp;&nbsp;the prompt. In some countries, most people prefer&nbsp;to rent their houses rather than buy their houses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, so I'm going to rewrite this essay prompt,&nbsp;not the question, the prompt the first part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine says, In some countries, many people decide&nbsp;that renting their home is preferable to buying&nbsp;&nbsp;it. Notice how some words and phrases are&nbsp;exactly the same. That's fine. Notice how&nbsp;&nbsp;some words are the same, but I've changed&nbsp;the word forms like prefer and preferable.&nbsp;&nbsp;And notice that I've used some synonyms, different&nbsp;words that have very similar or the same meaning.</p>
<p>And I've also used a pronoun instead of a noun&nbsp;there as well. So far, so good. We've started&nbsp;&nbsp;broad and now we're tightening our essay, we're&nbsp;focusing in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your teacher or examiner so far,&nbsp;&nbsp;we'll be super impressed. Who's this wonderful&nbsp;student they'll ask?</p>
<p>Introduction sentence&nbsp;&nbsp;number three, write your thesis statement,&nbsp;tell the reader what you will write about.&nbsp;&nbsp;So a thesis just means an argument or your&nbsp;position or what you think. Okay, so here we&nbsp;&nbsp;tell the reader, your teacher or examiner, our&nbsp;two ideas from our plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me show you mine.&nbsp;&nbsp;My thesis statement says, In this essay, I&nbsp;will discuss why renting can allow for a more&nbsp;&nbsp;flexible lifestyle, but why it can eventually&nbsp;be financially disadvantageous.</p>
<p>Can you see the&nbsp;&nbsp;two ideas from my plan in here? And can you see&nbsp;how explicit I'm being, I will discuss or you&nbsp;&nbsp;can write, I will compare or I will argue, or I&nbsp;will show and then simply write your two ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's now continue on to the body paragraphs. And&nbsp;remember to subscribe for more videos on English&nbsp;&nbsp;grammar and vocab that's going to help your&nbsp;essay writing improve fast. The body paragraphs.</p>
<p>So in the introduction, we told the reader what&nbsp;we'll tell them and now we need to tell them. Your&nbsp;&nbsp;body paragraphs are where you take the two ideas&nbsp;from your plan and you write a paragraph about&nbsp;&nbsp;each of them. This is the meat in your sandwich.&nbsp;Now your body paragraphs also have a structure.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each body paragraph will have four parts not&nbsp;necessarily four sentences, you can write more,&nbsp;&nbsp;but four underlying parts.</p>
<h2>First a topic sentence&nbsp;where you introduce your main idea.</h2>
<p>Second,&nbsp;&nbsp;a sentence where you give a reason or an example.&nbsp;Third, a sentence where you give another reason&nbsp;&nbsp;or example. And fourth, and finally, a sentence&nbsp;where you summarise your idea. This is the broad&nbsp;&nbsp;structure, and you can leave out a reason if&nbsp;you want to or add two examples.</p>
<p>It's up to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's go through each part of the body&nbsp;paragraph sentence by sentence now,&nbsp;&nbsp;so you're 100% Clear. And so your body&nbsp;paragraph matches up with your introduction.&nbsp;&nbsp;So remember, in your thesis statement, the third&nbsp;part of your introduction you said in this essay,&nbsp;&nbsp;I will. I said in this essay, I will discuss why&nbsp;renting can allow for a more flexible lifestyle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I now need to write my paragraph about that.&nbsp;By doing that we're connecting our introduction&nbsp;&nbsp;to our body paragraph like this.</p>
<p>So here's my&nbsp;first body paragraph. The main benefit of renting&nbsp;&nbsp;a house rather than buying one is because you can&nbsp;move at any time. If you change jobs, for example,&nbsp;&nbsp;and your new office is far away, then you can rent&nbsp;a house closer to work, which will save you lots&nbsp;&nbsp;of time commuting or for whatever reason crime&nbsp;becomes an issue in your local neighbourhood,&nbsp;&nbsp;you can pack up your belongings and move.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Clearly there are advantages to renting a home.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's unpack it. Here is my topic sentence&nbsp;where I make it very clear what the paragraph&nbsp;&nbsp;is about. It's not a mystery story, I make it&nbsp;explicit. The main benefit of renting a house&nbsp;&nbsp;rather than buying one is because you can move at&nbsp;any time.</p>
<p>Great. Now I need a reason or an example&nbsp;&nbsp;to back up that main idea. If you change jobs, for&nbsp;example, or your new office is far away, then you&nbsp;&nbsp;can rent a house closer to work, which will save&nbsp;you lots of time commuting. Now I need another&nbsp;&nbsp;reason or another example to give my main idea&nbsp;even more support.</p>
<p>Or for whatever reason, crime&nbsp;&nbsp;becomes an issue in your local neighbourhood,&nbsp;you can pack up your belongings and move.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, I now need to summarise my main&nbsp;idea in a short little wrap up sentence. Clearly&nbsp;&nbsp;being able to move is a key advantage of renting.&nbsp;Can you see how the final wrap up sentence also&nbsp;&nbsp;connects back to the essay question prompt. It's&nbsp;very clever. Now for your second body paragraph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Just repeat that structure again with your second&nbsp;idea. Simple, powerful. By now you're well on your&nbsp;&nbsp;way to an a plus or a top score.</p>
<p>Now we're going&nbsp;to put it all together and write a conclusion that&nbsp;&nbsp;mirrors the introduction and re-iterates the main&nbsp;ideas mentioned in our body paragraph one and two,&nbsp;&nbsp;the conclusion. The conclusion is simple to&nbsp;write.</p>
<p>You're not writing anything creative,&nbsp;&nbsp;and you're not adding new ideas. In the&nbsp;conclusion you're simply repeating or&nbsp;&nbsp;reiterating what you've already said. Remember&nbsp;the paragraph purposes we discussed earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the introduction, you tell the reader what&nbsp;you will tell them. In your body paragraphs&nbsp;&nbsp;you tell them and in the conclusion,&nbsp;you tell the reader what you told them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Easy. So our conclusion will have two parts,&nbsp;not necessarily two sentences, but two parts.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first part of the conclusion, you will&nbsp;write, this essay discussed or argued or compared&nbsp;&nbsp;or showed and then you'll express main idea&nbsp;one and main idea two.</p>
<p>And in the second&nbsp;&nbsp;part of your conclusion, you'll give your&nbsp;opinion. Notice how that first sentence of&nbsp;&nbsp;the conclusion almost perfectly mirrors the final&nbsp;sentence of the introduction that we saw earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The thesis statement of the introduction,&nbsp;the final sentence of the introduction said&nbsp;&nbsp;in this essay I will and the first sentence&nbsp;of the conclusion says in this essay I did&nbsp;&nbsp;I argued I discussed I showed. This is how you&nbsp;create that powerful, coherent and logical flow. And the final sentence, the in&nbsp;my opinion part, that's easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;You just give your opinion. Here's my&nbsp;conclusion.</p>
<p>In this essay, I argue that&nbsp;&nbsp;renting provides greater flexibility while&nbsp;owning results in greater financial reward.&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I prefer to rent so that I can live&nbsp;a more flexible lifestyle. Can you see how I've&nbsp;&nbsp;repeated my main idea one and my main idea two in&nbsp;the first sentence of the conclusion? And you can&nbsp;&nbsp;you see how I've given my opinion in the second&nbsp;sentence to finish the entire essay? Recap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;So today, we've learned an essay structure that&nbsp;you can use for the rest of your life. It works&nbsp;&nbsp;for every essay type, and every question prompt&nbsp;in any situation.</p>
<p>It's powerful, because it's&nbsp;&nbsp;interconnected, and it keeps you on topic. Th e&nbsp;logic and coherence of this structure is powerful,&nbsp;&nbsp;but you need to practice it. Once you do that,&nbsp;you can't forget it, it just makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's just recap the key concepts one more time.&nbsp;So in an essay, you need to tell the reader what&nbsp;&nbsp;you will tell them, in the introduction, then you&nbsp;tell them, in the body paragraphs, then you tell&nbsp;&nbsp;them what you told them in the conclusion.</p>
<p>Your&nbsp;introduction starts broad, paraphrases the essay&nbsp;&nbsp;prompt and finishes with your thesis statement.&nbsp;This essay will..</p>
<p>. Your body paragraphs have an&nbsp;&nbsp;opening or topic sentence where you introduce&nbsp;the main idea, give reasons and examples&nbsp;&nbsp;and then wrap up with a final sentence. Then,&nbsp;in your conclusion, you mirror your introduction&nbsp;&nbsp;and you write, In this essay I, whatever,&nbsp;argued disgust showed etc. And you simply&nbsp;&nbsp;finish with your personal opinion. Job done.</p>
<p>Cool.&nbsp;Hopefully that clarifies what an essay is and how&nbsp;&nbsp;to write it. Now you can get started just before&nbsp;you do that though.</p>
