            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Hey y'all. Welcome to our blog. I get a lot of questions about this, so here comes the article about German citizenship.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you as well. I'm going to start by summarizing the prerequisites. How long does it take? The cost of it and the steps.</p>
<p>There are like six or seven stops to be able to go through the whole process. Let's get started.</p>
<p>So, essentially, the record sets are living either six to eight years in Germany, depending on what you do and what you did before. It can go down to six years; it's usually eight years.</p>
<p>I will link&nbsp;&nbsp;some websites below so you can check it out and you neither need to have a residence permit or&nbsp;&nbsp;ideally a blue card. one thing I learned along the way is that, you need to not be in your probation&nbsp;&nbsp;period at work.</p>
<p>so if you have like six months of probation period you should apply afterwards. There is also a checklist before you schedule a phone call with the government official so you&nbsp;&nbsp;can also check it in their website and how long does it take that depends in which state you are&nbsp;&nbsp;in Germany and how lucky you are I was lucky enough to get it in around six months from my&nbsp;&nbsp;first phone call to actually getting in it took one year but from the application to getting&nbsp;&nbsp;the citizenship the ID it took me around six months so it depends I know friends who got&nbsp;&nbsp;it in two years it was in a different state I got mine in Barbarian so I got lucky and I also know&nbsp;&nbsp;friends who applied in the same city as I am who actually longer for the process so it just&nbsp;&nbsp;depends but the cost of it other than living in Germany and I want you that to be able to get to&nbsp;&nbsp;the citizenship the process itself is not that costly so it's and a few hundred euros really&nbsp;&nbsp;getting the citizenship document cost me 255 Euros new passport and ID cost me 90 euros and giving&nbsp;&nbsp;up my other citizenship was around 30 Euros so it's actually a lot cheaper than I thought&nbsp;&nbsp;um it was actually cheaper than all the residence permits I got before applying for the citizenship&nbsp;&nbsp;so let's start with the process there are a lot of steps bureaucracy and Drew me one thing to&nbsp;&nbsp;note I'm doing this in English because maybe it will help some International people but the&nbsp;&nbsp;process itself isn't German everything is in German so I will mention some German words for&nbsp;&nbsp;some long words you need to at least have B1 level of German so you need to be able to go&nbsp;&nbsp;through the process enjoyment so the first step is scheduling a phone call with the government&nbsp;&nbsp;official in my state there is like an online form you can do like checklist and after that if you're&nbsp;&nbsp;eligible you get to schedule a phone call with the government official I schedule this interview and&nbsp;&nbsp;talk with the government official and through all of my documents what I need and like&nbsp;&nbsp;um can I apply he said it would take longer to apply online because there is a long queue&nbsp;&nbsp;and it would be faster via post so instead of applying online I got a lot of documents via post&nbsp;&nbsp;and I needed to fill them out and send it to the government office afterwards so that's the first&nbsp;&nbsp;stop I scheduled a phone call got a lot of papers and the second step is filling out the application&nbsp;&nbsp;where I call one kilogram of documents so you need to fill a lot of forms about yourself your family&nbsp;&nbsp;about your background and then there is like um long I think seven pages are on some organizations&nbsp;&nbsp;that you cannot be a part of you have to check no in each organization they're related to some&nbsp;&nbsp;terrorist organizations or stuff like that so obviously they don't want to include um people&nbsp;&nbsp;from that background in the citizenship so there is like a lot to fill out and they just send it&nbsp;&nbsp;to you by a post or if you want to do online application you can also see the PDF documents&nbsp;&nbsp;for it online and if you are an employee they need a information letter from your employer it's just&nbsp;&nbsp;a one page your employer should fill out I send it to rhr and they did it it's not a big deal they&nbsp;&nbsp;say like you're employed there that's a real and good person yay you need to show proof that you&nbsp;&nbsp;can speak German at least be one level and there is like a task for citizenship if you want to go&nbsp;&nbsp;down to a six-year period which is faster than the eight year and it's called naturalization tests or&nbsp;&nbsp;uh einberg's test I went to a German high school so I had the German high school diploma called ABI&nbsp;&nbsp;tour and I showed my aperture for the instead of the einberg earrings test and instead of&nbsp;&nbsp;um the proof that I can speak German like um language certificate or something so the high&nbsp;&nbsp;school diploma goes for both naturalization tasks and your language skills which is a good thing and&nbsp;&nbsp;instead of like this naturalization task if you study law or related to the country's regulation&nbsp;&nbsp;you can also show that the third step is letters letters letters letters letters back and forth&nbsp;&nbsp;so after your application you got like oh your application is in confirmation of application and&nbsp;&nbsp;if you wait long enough you got another thing this is called naturalization Assurance or internment longboard Welcome to Germany!</p>
<p>So, depending on which country you're from and where your other citizenship is, you have different options. if you keep both your previous citizenship and get the German one it's&nbsp;&nbsp;the process is actually faster I had to give up my other citizenship in order to get the German one&nbsp;&nbsp;so I needed to go through different stops smart Fort stop was giving up my other citizenship I&nbsp;&nbsp;had to go to the Embassy so you got a confirmation that I could give up my citizenship that's another&nbsp;&nbsp;thing and then this is called a loudness or condom which is permission certificate from&nbsp;&nbsp;my home country and you need to send this to the German office this is step five if you're&nbsp;&nbsp;changing the citizenship and after a long while each step can take a few months by the way so&nbsp;&nbsp;um in the fifth step I went to the Embassy and waited for the letter for two months to&nbsp;&nbsp;get back to me and I needed to go to the Embassy again to pick this document up&nbsp;&nbsp;so everything takes a while because it evolves bureaucracy and different kinds of governments&nbsp;&nbsp;the sixth step is the late letter you are waiting for you need to go and pick it up&nbsp;&nbsp;yay and need to go there personally and you need to go to the actual office to get it so&nbsp;&nbsp;um the appointment is scheduled online this is important they get your residence permit so you&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot travel or go anywhere else until you get your German ID or passport because the certificate&nbsp;&nbsp;they give you einberg which is the like naturalization certificate it's not valid as an&nbsp;&nbsp;ID but I suggest is before going to disappointment just get an appointment to get your ID and or&nbsp;&nbsp;passport so that you would have some type of document for you to be able to travel in Europe&nbsp;&nbsp;and like you know not wait a long time before you can actually do something in my situation I signed&nbsp;&nbsp;that I would need to give up my other citizenship within four months so it's very important that you&nbsp;&nbsp;would get your German ID and passport within four months to be able to give up the other citizenship&nbsp;&nbsp;because otherwise you would be like country-less that's not really a good thing I would assume&nbsp;&nbsp;um just check it online depending on your site obviously I live in Munich so I got&nbsp;&nbsp;my appointment online and I checked it almost every day if I can get a new appointment it's&nbsp;&nbsp;just how it is and I was lucky enough to actually get the appointment on the day that I got the&nbsp;&nbsp;citizenship it was within a half an hour I probably someone canceled and I was like can&nbsp;&nbsp;I make it yes I can today I got the citizenship certificate I applied for my German ID and the&nbsp;&nbsp;passport but I got lucky and if I wasn't to be lucky I scheduled my appointment like one&nbsp;&nbsp;month before one important advice I would give to anyone who needs to uh drop the other citizenship&nbsp;&nbsp;in order to get the German one and the last stop in the process which was the seventh step for me&nbsp;&nbsp;was giving up my other citizenship it was sad to be honest but um I knew that there was a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;benefits for me to get the German citizenship I tried to focus on the positive in that sense and&nbsp;&nbsp;you just sent this document via email or post to the German officials that you gave up your&nbsp;&nbsp;other citizenship and that's it that's how I became German and if you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;become German I wish you all the best with the process hope you get lucky as well and if you&nbsp;&nbsp;have any questions write down below subscribe for more see you next time thanks a lot bye</p>
