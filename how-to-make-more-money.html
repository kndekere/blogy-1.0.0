            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Hello and welcome. I want to talk to you for a few minutes about money if you're interested in&nbsp;making more of it. Do you now there is not many people that really understand this subject?</p>
<p>It's an important subject, so I would suggest you listen very carefully. If you would really like to earn a lot of money, and I'm talking about earning it all over the world, not just in your own backyard, we're not living with a corner store any more.</p>
<p>We're living in a global market. I'm Kiritu Ndekere. And I'm going to share something with you that literally changed the course of my life and it'll change your life too if you listen real carefully.</p>
<p>You see, a man introduced me to this book, "Think and Grow Rich" by Napoleon Hill, but he also gave me direction.</p>
<p>And he said, "Bob, I've gotten to know you fairly," he said, "you seem to be hung up "on the fact that you didn't go to school "and that you've never had a good job." He said, "None of that matters. "Now, you told me that you want "to learn how to earn more money, "I'll tell you there's only one prerequisite "for earning a lot of money, just one, "and very few people understand this.</p>
<p>"A lot of people go to school to learn how to earn money, "school does not teach us how to earn money.</p>
<p>"The professors don't know how to earn money. "School teaches you how to gather information. "If you want to learn how to earn money, "that's a totally different subject." And he said, "There's only one "prerequisite if you can follow direction." Now, he said, "Bob, if you can follow direction, you can learn how to do anything."</p>
<p>"It's got nothing to do with your age, "your gender, your formal education or your background. "If you will follow direction, "I can show you how to earn a lot of money." Now, it's not a difficult subject, and it's something that anybody can learn. If you truly want to earn a lot more money, you can, but there's a basic secret, and when you get ahold of that secret, everything changes for you.</p>
<h2>And it did for me.</h2>
<p>It changed for me many years ago and I've earned millions of dollars and I can show you how to do it. It doesn't matter where you live, it really doesn't matter what you're doing. Now, I want to tell you a story. I was going to Malaysia over to Kuala Lumpur from Toronto every month for almost five years. I was about 25 hours in the air.</p>
<p>If you go any further, you're coming back, so it was a long ride. And every time, I would sit and I would take my pen and I would play with words or numbers.</p>
<p>And one day I wrote a million down and I thought what is the real big secret to earning a million dollars? You know we've written songs about it, we play little games, what would you do if you won a million. And it seems to be a magic number.</p>
<p>And I figured it out. And we have been teaching this to people for a long time. We have a number of programs in our company that teach people how to really make things happen. You see, our world is changing. And it's changing so rapidly, most people have difficulty keeping up.</p>
<p>And the world's not getting bigger. As a matter of fact, the world's shrinking. The world is getting smaller. You can go anywhere in a short period of time now. As a matter of fact, you can earn money from all over the world.</p>
<p>You can have money coming to you from every corner of the Earth if that's what you want to do, and I can show you how to do it. You see, the Proctor Gallagher Institute took one idea and it mixed into every program that we teach. We've got a number of programs, but the main focus of them all is show a person how to become financially stable. If a person hasn't got any money, they're not going to live properly in this kind of a world.</p>
<h2>This is a very commercialized world today.</h2>
<p>Money is a medium of exchange, it's what we use for other people's products or services. When you haven't got it, things just don't seem to run very well. So we have one basic concept that we go with. Everybody is taught how to set up earn multiple sources of income. Now, not everybody does it, but everyone can.</p>
<p>And we actually teach you how to do it. And what do I mean by that? Well, you set up sources of income in various parts of the world. And we work with people all over the world.</p>
<p>You see, when we run a program, we have people come from all over the world to our programs.</p>
<p>We show them how to set up joint ventures, how to mix with other people, how to get other people supporting you and how you can support other people. You can set up joint ventures with people, you can set up affiliate programs with other people, but the beautiful part about it is the money all comes to you.</p>
<p>Now, some of them are big, some of the businesses are big and some are small, but you can be earning money while you're sleeping, and that's what we teach you how to do, and I don't care what your background is, the one prerequisite, can you follow direction. Now, think about it for a moment. Some of these sources that you build will be big and some will be small, but they all flow into your bank.</p>
<p>It's a beautiful concept, and anybody can do it. Now think about it, if this is something you're interested in, I want to show you how to do it.</p>
<p>Earl Nightingale put it very well. He said, "Most people think they "want more money than they really do, "and they settle for a whole lot less than they can earn." Don't settle, don't settle for one second.</p>
<p>If you truly want to learn how to earn more money, then <a href="https://www.ndekere.xyz/contact.html" target="_blank">contact us</a> and do it right now. This is Kiritu Ndekere, and I'll look forward to working with you.</p>
